Objective:
Develop a clean, minimalistic blog website with cool and subtle design elements using React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. The design should be highly aesthetic, modern, and focused on a great user experience, using AI tools to help create and optimize it via Bolt.new.

Design Style:
1. Color Palette:
Primary Colors:

White (background) – to maintain a clean, bright, and open feel.

Soft Gray (for section dividers, background elements) – to add depth while maintaining a minimalist look.

Accent Colors:

Muted Blue (#0077cc) – for buttons, links, and small interactive elements like hover effects.

Soft Coral (#FF6B6B) – subtle highlights for call-to-action buttons, category tags, and interactive icons.

Text Color:

Dark Gray (#333333) for body text – providing excellent contrast on white backgrounds.

Black for headlines and titles to make them stand out sharply.

Additional Highlights:

Use a Pastel Yellow (#F7D774) or Soft Lavender (#B19CD9) for subtle, yet modern visual cues in hover animations and icons.

2. Typography:
Font Family:

Primary Font: Inter – Modern, clean, and highly readable. This font will be used for all body text and paragraph content.

Headings Font: Poppins or Montserrat – Use for headings to give a more structured, bold presence. This font is perfect for a modern, sans-serif style that pairs well with Inter.

Font Sizes:

Body text: 16px for normal content and 18px for larger paragraphs.

Titles: 36px for main post titles, with clear padding and spacing around them.

Subheadings: 20px, with additional weight (semi-bold or bold).

Line Height:

Set the line height to 1.6 for body text to ensure readability and spacing.

Set the line height for headings to 1.3 for a more compact, organized feel.

3. Layout & Structure:
Homepage Layout:

Hero Section:

Large image or video background with a faded overlay for text contrast.

Use Tailwind's utilities (bg-opacity-70, text-white, etc.) for a subtle, effective overlay that doesn’t overpower the content.

Center-align the blog name or tagline with big, bold text. Use Poppins/Montserrat here for emphasis.

Featured Posts:

Display posts in a two-column grid for larger screens and a single-column layout for mobile views. This is achieved with Tailwind's grid layout.

Posts should be shown with large thumbnails, title, and a short description beneath each. Hover effects will slightly enlarge the post cards.

Minimal Navigation Bar:

Transparent background that transitions to a solid color when scrolled.

Links will be text-white and have soft hover effects (change to muted blue).

Use React Router for navigation, with simple routes (Home, Blog, About, Contact).

Blog Post Pages:

Single column layout with large body text.

Use Tailwind's typography plugin (prose) for content styling.

Image handling should ensure that all images are responsive (e.g., w-full, h-auto).

For post titles, use Poppins/Montserrat in bold, with an emphasis on contrast with body text.

Sidebar (Optional):

Display recent posts, category tags, and email subscription form.

Ensure the sidebar is fixed on the right side (in larger views) but can be collapsed for mobile devices.

4. Interactive Design Elements:
Hover Effects:

Soft fade effect on hover for links, category tags, and buttons.

Buttons (e.g., “Read More” links) will change from the muted blue to the soft coral color on hover.

Blog post thumbnails will enlarge slightly on hover to create depth and interactivity.

Scrolling Effects:

Use smooth scroll for page navigation and image reveal (for blog posts, image pop-ins) as users scroll down.

Animations:

Subtle entrance animations on page load: fade-in effect for posts, menu items, and images.

Subtle scale-up effect for call-to-action buttons like “Subscribe” or “Read More” on hover.

5. Forms:
Contact Form:

Simple form with inputs for Name, Email, and Message.

Use soft gray borders for the input fields and soft coral color on hover for inputs.

Use subtle transitions when the user submits the form (e.g., change form button background to muted blue when clicked).

6. Footer Design:
A minimal footer with copyright text, social media links, and a short description or about section.

Social media icons will be simple line icons (such as those from React Icons), with a hover effect that changes their color to the accent colors (muted blue or soft coral).

7. Responsiveness:
Ensure all components are responsive, using Tailwind's responsive utilities (such as lg:grid-cols-2, sm:w-full).

Use Tailwind's mobile-first approach, ensuring smooth transitions between breakpoints.

For mobile screens, collapse the navigation into a hamburger menu with React Hooks to manage the open/close state.

Images and videos should scale automatically based on screen size (using object-fit: cover or w-full classes).
